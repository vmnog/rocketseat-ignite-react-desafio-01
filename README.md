# ToDo App | Vite + React + TS + TailwindCSS

This is a simple yet powerful ToDo application, built with React and TypeScript. The application allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively. This project is part of a frontend course, where the figma and the features were provided, but the entire codebase was developed by me independently.

## Figma Design

The user interface of the ToDo application was designed using Figma. You can view the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/0n0zDN7zbzhRbaEO74Xesx/ToDo-List/duplicate).

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

> Note: This project recommends using `pnpm` as the package manager due to its efficient package management strategy.

## Installation

Clone the project from the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/vmnog/todo
```

Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd todo
```

Install the required dependencies using `pnpm`.

```
pnpm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `pnpm lint`

Launches the linter in the interactive watch mode. 

### `pnpm preview`

This runs the built app in preview mode.
